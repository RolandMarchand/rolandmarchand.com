## Introduction

C is the best language. It has functions, variables, the `volatile` keyword,
what's there not to love?

Well, its error messages, apparently.

Have you ever worked on a big project filled with state machines and pointer
arithmetic through the wazoo, compiled it successfully with no warnings, only to
run it and see `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`? This sucks, because it gives
you no information on why it failed, or what you should do to fix it. When you
see this error, it's debugging time.

Assuming you don't use an IDE (in that case, use its included debugger), here
are the tools you'll need:

1) The Gnu Debugger (GDB) 2) A C compiler (e.g. GCC) 3) A text editor
(e.g. Nano)

They're all incredibly common pieces of software, and assuming you're on Linux,
all of these tools (including your OS) have "GNU" in the name. So it shouldn't
be too hard to get a hold of them using your distro's package manager.

If you're on Windows, you should be using [Visual
Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and its debugging tools.

## What is GDB
GDB is a tool to analyze your code. With it, you can know the value of any
variable in your program at any time, what functions call which in what order,
which tests pass and which don't, how many times a loop loops, etc.

Chances are you wanted this information at some point, so you peppered
`printf` statements all throughout your code. You knew there was a better
option, but you didn't want to bother with figuring it out. Maybe You heard of
GDB, but when you ran the command, you were greeted by a scary shell and you
thought "to hell with this!"

It's not as scary as it seems. Here is how you setup GDB with a live view of
your code.

## Compiling
Let's take this piece of code as an example:
```c
// debug.c
int loop(int arg) {
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		arg += i;
	}
	return arg;
}

int main(void) {
	int i = 20;
	i = loop(i);
	return i;
}
```

Before running GDB, you need to compile your binary with debug symbols. The
debugger needs those to read your binary's code. Compile your program with the
`-g` flag on either GCC or Clang like so: `gcc -g debug.c -o debug`.

Now, let's debug!

## Entering the Debugger

Entering the debugger is pretty straight-forward: `gdb --ex "layout src"
./debug`.

The option `--ex "layout src"` is entirely optional, it's just there to grant
you a window to view your source code and where the execution is at. If you
don't want to write this line at every invocation, enter the command `echo
"layout src" >> $HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit`.

## Breakpoints

Debugging is done by analyzing the state of the program, but which state? Since
the program can potentially change state at every line, you must specify points
at which the program will pause so you can analyze it. Those points are
called breakpoints.

You will use breakpoints in conjunction with almost every other debugging
commands in GDB, but by they can still be useful by themselves. They can show
you where your code reaches. Not sure if a certain function is called, or if
your code goes into the *if* or the *else*? You only need one breakpoint to find
out.

In GDB, the command is intuitively named `break`. You can set breakpoints at
specific lines of functions or files. For functions, specifying a line is
optional, and will default to the first line of the function.

Let's break at the main function of our program with the command `break
main`. You should see a `b+` left of line 10.

## Running

Once your breakpoints are set, you can run your program with the command
`run`. If you want to give your program arguments (in the case of our program,
it receives none), give them as arguments to the `run` command.

Enter the run command, and your program should stop at the breakpoint you've set
if you've done everything correctly.

Keep in mind you can restart the program at any point! If you went too far, want
to test an earlier line, or want to try different arguments, just use the `run`
command again.

## Next Line

We can stop the program anywhere we want, great! But how do we move around? Here
are the most important commands:

* `next` to the next line. It does not enter functions, but it does loop around
  *for*, *do* and *while* loops.
* `step` is like `next`, but it enters functions.
* `up` is like `next`, but it skips loops.
* `continue` to resume your code's execution as normal until it hits another
  breakpoint.
* `return` to return from the current function.
  
Now try it out by entering the `next` command, your cursor should be at
line 11. Don't hesitate to mess around with the movement a bit, and just use the
`run` command if something unexpected happened.

You'll probably want to go to the next line pretty often, and entering "next" 50
times isn't fun. In that case, you can either enter a shortcut for the command
(`n`, `s`, `u`, `c` and `ret` respectively), or enter an empty line, which will
run the previous command.

> **Note:** Almost all commands have shortcuts, you can learn them with `help
> <command>`.

> **Note:** While moving around and printing information (more on that next
> section), you may get your terminal to look weird and corrupt. It's only a
> display bug. To fix it, redraw your screen with the shortcut `Ctrl-L`.

## Reading Variables

This one is pretty straight-forward, use `print` command to print the value of
any variable (or function!).

Try it out with `print i`, 20 should print out. Mind blown.

Another method is to use the extremely versatile `info` command with the `local`
argument for local variables, and `args` for function arguments.

The `print` and `info` commands are very powerful and configurable. You can
print data as any data type, configure how you want your structures and arrays
to be printed, retreive information on your cache, threads, OS, scopes, etc.

Be sure to read the resources in [Learn More](#learn-more) once you feel
comfortable with the debugger.

And with that, we've nearly completely eliminated the need to test with
*printf()* statements.

## Stack Frame

You now know enough to debug effectively, everything listed above is 70% of what
you're going to use. But there is one last thing I'd like to touch on: the frame
stack.

The stack frame is the path the program took to get a to a certain function
call. If function *main()* calls function *game_loop()*, which calls function
*move_player()*, and a breakpoint is reached in the last function, then the
stack frame printed with the `backtrace` command will look like this:

```
#0  move_player (x=0, y=0) at test.c:11
#1  0x0000000000401151 in game_loop () at test.c:15
#2  0x0000000000401179 in main () at test.c:21
```

This can be very useful to know. If your function doesn't work as expected, but
only *sometimes*, then it may have something to do with the functions that were
called before it. The stack frame can also be used to capture hard-to-find
recursion bugs.

It's also possible to move from frame to frame with the `frame` command. In the
example above, the debugger is currently at frame 0. If you want to see what's
going on in the *main()* function at this point in time, use `frame 2` to jump
to the last frame. From there, you can see where *game_loop()* is called, and
what are the current variables' values.

## Learn More
GDB is an enormous and powerful program, I highly recommend learning how to best
utilize it. The documentation is excellent, internal and external.

You can learn more about any command in GDB with the `help` command, and you can
read the user manual [here](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/).
